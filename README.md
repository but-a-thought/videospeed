# Video Speed Controller — Community

**Video Speed Controller** gives you fine-grained control over any HTML5 video
or audio element, on any site.

This community-maintained fork builds Chrome and Firefox extensions from one shared codebase.
It preserves the original extension's behavior while adding Firefox support and compatibility
fixes for sites and extensions such as Hover Zoom.

## Install

### Chrome

[Install the Chrome version from the Chrome Web Store][chrome-web-store-link].

### Firefox 128+

Firefox requires a Mozilla-signed `.xpi` for a normal, persistent installation. The Firefox
package is named **Video Speed Controller — Community**. Unlisted beta versions are distributed
directly and do not appear in Firefox Add-ons search. Only install the signed `.xpi`; the
unsigned ZIP produced by the build is intended for AMO submission and local testing.

To test a local build temporarily:

1. Run `npm ci`, then `npm run build:firefox`.
2. Open `about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox` in Firefox.
3. Select **Load Temporary Add-on** and choose `dist/firefox/manifest.json`.

Temporary add-ons are removed when Firefox closes.

## Build from source

Node.js 22 or newer is recommended. The stable build commands are:

| Command                 | Output                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `npm run build`         | Chrome development build in `dist/chrome`   |
| `npm run build:firefox` | Firefox development build in `dist/firefox` |
| `npm run build:all`     | Both development builds                     |
| `npm run release`       | Validated Chrome, Firefox, and source ZIPs  |

Release and reviewer instructions are documented in [docs/release.md](docs/release.md) and
[docs/firefox-reviewer-build.md](docs/firefox-reviewer-build.md).

## The science of accelerated playback

**TL;DR** -- faster playback translates to better engagement and retention.

The average adult reads at [250-300 words per minute][wpm-study] (wpm). Speech
averages ~150 wpm; slide presentations often closer to 100 wpm. Given the
choice, most viewers [speed up playback to ~1.3-1.5x][ms-study] to close the
gap. Accelerated viewing [keeps attention longer][byu-study] -- faster delivery
means higher engagement. With practice, many settle at 2x or above and find it
[uncomfortable to return to 1x][mit-study].

HTML5 media elements expose a native playback rate API, but most players hide
or artificially limit it. Speed adjustments should be effortless and frequent:
we don't read at a fixed pace, and we shouldn't watch at one either.

## Features

- **Universal** - works on any site with HTML5 media: YouTube, Netflix,
  Coursera, podcasts, local files, etc.
- **Video and audio** - controls both `<video>` and `<audio>` elements.
- **Fine-grained speed** - 0.07x to 16x in configurable increments.
- **Per-site speed rules** - set a default playback speed for specific domains
  (e.g., always 2x on lecture sites).
- **Per-site disable** - turn off the controller on sites where you don't
  want it.
- **Remember speed** - optionally persist your last speed across sessions
  and tabs.
- **Speed fightback** - automatically re-applies your chosen speed when a
  site's player tries to reset it.
- **Draggable overlay** - reposition the on-video speed indicator anywhere
  you like.
- **Fully customizable shortcuts** - remap every key, add modifier combos
  (Ctrl, Shift, Alt), create multiple preferred-speed toggles.
- **Custom controller CSS** - style or reposition the overlay with your own
  CSS rules.
- **Hover Zoom compatibility** - keeps one visible controller on locked Reddit previews and
  synchronizes split video/audio playback.

## Default keyboard shortcuts

- **S** - decrease playback speed
- **D** - increase playback speed
- **R** - reset playback speed to 1.0x
- **Z** - rewind video by 10 seconds
- **X** - advance video by 10 seconds
- **G** - toggle between current and preferred speed
- **V** - show/hide the controller
- **M** - set a marker at current position
- **J** - jump back to the previously set marker

All shortcuts are fully customizable in the extension's settings page. You can
reassign keys, add modifier combinations, and define multiple preferred-speed
shortcuts with different values for quick toggling. Click **Add New** in
settings to create additional bindings. Refresh the page after making changes
for them to take effect.
